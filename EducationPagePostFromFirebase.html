                    <p class="py-2 postBody" id="postBody">Not long ago, one of my third graders was struggling to find books he liked. His teacher reported that he kept picking up titles that were far too simple or far too difficult for him to manage successfully on his own. In addition to not being able to find books he wanted, he struggled to read them once he had them.  <br><br>

                      I’m a pre-K through 6 librarian, so I visited with this student one morning one-on-one to find out what he was looking for. He started telling me that he just didn’t like to read. He couldn’t specifically tell me that he wanted a particular genre or style of book, but after a bit of conversation, he shared that he loved dragons. <br><br>
                      
                      I immediately thought of the <a href=""> Dragon Masters series published by Scholastic </a>in their Branches collection. I took the first installment off the shelf and showed it to him. He started to smile, and when I opened the book, there were illustrations to help him comprehend the story more easily. He was super-excited. 
                      <br><br>
                      We sat down to read a bit together to see if it was a good fit as an independent reading title. He launched in with gusto, but it quickly became apparent that his decoding skills were not yet strong enough for him to tackle that book. He was dejected, but I told him I had an idea. 
                      <br><br>
                      We logged into his Sora account (a reading app with e-books and audiobooks) and searched for an audiobook version of the first Dragon Masters book. We checked it out, as well as the print copy, from our library and picked up a bookmark to hold under each line as the narrator read so he could follow along. 
                      <br><br>
                      His face lit up like a pinball machine! Two days later, he was back in the library doing the “I-gotta-have-the-next-book” dance. We found it on the shelf, and I coached him again through finding it on Sora, downloading it, and following along. 
                      <br><br>
                      The last time I checked, he was nearing the end of the series. In the meantime, I will encourage him to check them out again and try to read them himself this time until a new one in the series is published. We’ve now pushed through a major hurdle: the idea that he didn’t like to read. He now knows that he does. 
                      <br><br>
                      Another day, a different student was a bit teary in the library. She told me that she really wanted to read a particular book that her friends were all talking about, but she knew she was not a strong reader. 
                      <br><br>
                      We found a print copy, navigated to Sora, and checked out the audiobook version. I encouraged her to follow along in the print version as the narrator told the story. 
                      <br><br>
                      The listening time of a novel-length audiobook can seem daunting. Together, we found out the length of the book and divided that amount of time by 21 days (our current checkout length). She discovered with excitement that in just 20 minutes a day, she could listen to the whole thing in three weeks. 
                      <br><br>
                      In the future, my hope is that each and every child will have access to science- and evidence-based reading instruction that works, allowing the vast majority of students to successfully navigate the path to becoming confident, independent readers. But my work of connecting children with books must continue in the interim. </p>
